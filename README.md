# Forecasting Gold Prices using Machine Learning

This project aims to forecast the future prices of gold using various machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and employing advanced algorithms, the project seeks to provide accurate predictions for gold prices, enabling users to make informed decisions in the financial market. 

The project's evaluation of different models reveals that XGBoost Regression outperforms both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression in accurately forecasting gold prices. The evaluation metrics used, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-Squared Error, demonstrate the superior performance of the XGBoost model.
